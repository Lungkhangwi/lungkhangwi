<body>
<p>
	The Euclid–Euler theorem is a theorem in number theory that relates perfect numbers to Mersenne primes. It states that an even number is perfect if and only if it has the form 2<sup>p−1</sup>(2<sup>p</sup> − 1), where 2<sup>p</sup> − 1 is a prime number. The theorem is named after mathematicians Euclid and Leonhard Euler, who respectively proved the "if" and "only if" aspects of the theorem.

<header>STATEMENT </header>
<p>A perfect number is a natural number that equals the sum of its proper divisors, the numbers that are less than it and divide it evenly (with remainder zero). For instance, the proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, and 3, which sum to 6, so 6 is perfect</p>
<p>A Mersenne prime is a prime number of the form <i>M<sub>b</sub> = 2<sup>p</sup> − 1</i>, one less than a power of two. For a number of this form to be prime, <i>p</i> itself must also be prime, but not all primes give rise to Mersenne primes in this way. For instance, 2<sup>3</sup> − 1 = 7 is a Mersenne prime, but 2<sup>11</sup> − 1 = 2047 = 23 × 89 is not.

</p>
<p>The Euclid–Euler theorem states that an even natural number is perfect if and only if it has the form <i>2<sup>p−1</sup>M<sub>p</sub></i>, where <i>M<sub>p</sub></i> is a Mersenne prime.The perfect number 6 comes from <i>p</i> = 2 in this way, as 2<sup>2−1</sup><i>M</i><sub>2</sub> = 2 × 3 = 6, and the Mersenne prime 7 corresponds in the same way to the perfect number 28.
